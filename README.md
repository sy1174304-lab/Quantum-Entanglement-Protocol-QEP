## 🌌 Overview
QEP is a revolutionary **Atomic-Level Data Protocol** designed for non-linear communication and unbreakable data entanglement. Unlike standard encryption, QEP utilizes a simulated **Quantum State Vector** to bind data with the fundamental properties of matter (Atoms).

This protocol provides the mathematical foundation for:
1. **Atomic Talk:** Interpreting sub-atomic vibrations into digital data.
2. **Abyss Extraction (Khai Logic):** Retrieving information from chaotic data streams.
3. **Unbreakable Security:** Data remains entangled and can only be decoded via the specific Sovereign State Key.

## 🛠️ Technical Logic (The Pure QEP)
The core logic resides in a 1024-dimension complex vector space. 
- **Encoding:** Data is projected into a high-dimensional quantum wave using a Dot Product with a Sovereign State.
- **Decoding:** Inverse projection is achieved through state-sum normalization, ensuring 0% data leakage.
